			<p>Business models of food ordering platforms can vary according to the project aims and requirements.
			</p>
			<p>Your food delivery service can be local or worldwide. According to McKinsey&Company, the worldwide food delivery market stands for â‚¬83 billion, so it takes only 1% of the total turnover. Such services as UberEats or Delivery.com can be called worldwide because they operate across several countries.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, there is a local or traditional model. It stands for common food delivery from nearby places. A lot of restaurants, especially in urban areas, now offer delivery. So local food delivery service usually works only within one country or even city.
			</p>
			<p>Food delivery gives many opportunities to start your own business. How to make a food delivery website? First of all, you need to choose an appropriate business model.</p>
